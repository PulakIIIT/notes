Let us first review Maxwell's equations:

\begin{align*}
&\div E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}~\text{(Electric charges produce fields)}\\
&\div B = 0~\text{(Only magnetic dipoles exist)}\\
&\curl E = - \pdv{B}{t}~\text{(Lenz Law - time varying magnetic field induces current that opposes it)} \\
&\curl B =  \mu_0 \bigg(J + \epsilon_0 \pdv{E}{t} \bigg)~\text{(Ampere's law + fudge factor)}
\end{align*}

Begin with the equation that $\div B = 0$. This tells that $B$ can be written
as the curl of some other field --- $B = \curl A$. Hence

\begin{equation}
B^i = \levicevita^{ijk}  \partial_j A^k
\end{equation}
