\chapter{Approximate Counting}

The idea is to see how many objects satisfy a given condition.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Count the number of spanning trees of a graph (matrix-tree theorem)
    \item Count the number of matchings of a given graph (permenant of a graph)
    \item Count the number of truth assignments that satisfy a formula in DNF
        (sum of products)
\end{itemize}

\section{Counting truth assignments in DNF}

DNF syntax is $DNF \equiv C_1 \lor C_2 \dots C_n$ where each $C_i \equiv L_1 \land L_2 \dots L_j$.
$L \equiv \texttt{literal}$, each literal is either a variable $X_k$, or its
negation $X_k'$.
Problem has uses in network design and reliability.

A truth assignment is said to satisfy a DNF boolean formula $F$, if some clause in $F$
is true in the assignment. We are interested in $\#F$ -- the number of distinct
satisfying assignments for $F$.

\section{DNF counting --- Problem formalization}

Let $U$ be a finite set of truth assignments, and a boolean function $f: U \mapsto \{0, 1\}$.
Define $G \equiv \{ u~\vert~f(u) = 1\}$.
We assume that given $u \in U$, $f(u)$ is easy to compute.
We also assume that it is possible to sample uniformly at random from $U$.
We want to estimate the size of $G$.

Note that the requirement that we can uniformly sample from $U$ is
quite important! We need an explicit encoding of the object to be able
to sample efficiently and uniformly at random.

\subsection{Solution --- Monte Carlo}

\subsubsection{Sketch}
Choose $N$ independent samples from $U$, say $u_1, u_2, \dots u_N$. Evaluate
$f$ at each one of these samples, and count the number of satisfying instances.
Use this count to estimate $G$.

\subsubsection{Details}

Let 
\begin{align*}
    &Y_i \equiv \text{random variable, indicates if $u_i \in G$} \\
    &Y_i = \begin{cases}
        1 & f(u_i) = 1 \\
        0 & f(u_i) = 0
    \end{cases} \\
    &\E{Y_i} = \Pr{[Y_i = 1]} = \frac{|G|}{|U|} \\
\end{align*}

Define another random variable:

\begin{align*}
    &Z \equiv \text{Size that we guess based on $Y_i$} \\
    &Z = |U| \cdot \frac{\sum_i Y_i}{N} \\
    &\E{Z} = \frac{|U|}{N}\E{\sum_i Y_i} =  \frac{|U|}{N} \sum_i \frac{|G|}{|U|} = |G|
\end{align*}

We want the value of $Z$ to be close to $|G|$. Once again, we can use Chernoff
bounds to approximate the tail inequality:

\begin{align*}
    &\epsilon \equiv \text{confidence of the estimate} \\
    & Y \equiv \sum_i Y_i \\
    & r \equiv \frac{|G|}{|U|},~ N \equiv |U|,~ Nr = |G| \\
    &\Pr \big[ (1 - \epsilon)|G| \leq Z \leq (1 + \epsilon)|G|) \big] \\
    &=\Pr \big[ (1 - \epsilon)|G| \leq \frac{|U|Y}{N} \leq (1 + \epsilon)|G| \big] \\
    &=\Pr \big[ (1 - \epsilon)Nr \leq  Y \leq (1 + \epsilon)Nr \big] \\
    &= 1 - \Pr \big[  Y \geq (1 + \epsilon)Nr \big] - \Pr \big[ Y \leq (1 - \epsilon)Nr \big]\\
    &\geq 1 - 2e^{-\epsilon^2 Nr / 4}
\end{align*}

Let $\delta \equiv 2e^{-\epsilon^2 Nr / 4}$. We want $\delta$ to be small.
So, we need $N$ and $r$ to be large for $\delta$ to be small. For this
to work, since $r \equiv |G|/|U|$, we need $|G|$ to be large. This means
that we need a large number of truth assignments for this to work.

\subsection{Importance sampling}
Do not rely on uniform sampling, so we use skewed sampling. Skew
towards useful samples. We want to increase $r \equiv |G|/|U|$.

Let $V$ be a finite universe. We are given $m$ subsets
$H_1, H_2, \dots H_m$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall i,~|H_i|$ can be computed in polynomial time.
\item It is possible to sample uniformly at random from any $H_i$.
\item For all $v \in V$, we can determine if $v \in H_i$ in polynomial time.
\end{itemize}

The goal is to estimate $H \equiv \bigcup_i H_i$.

In the equivalence to $DNF$, $V$ is all possible assignments,
each $H_i$ is the assignments that satisfy $C_i$. $|H_i| = 2^{n - \text{number of clauses not in $C_i$}}$.

\subsubsection{Set for sampling during importance sampling}

Define a multiset $U$ of the union of $H_i$s where the multiset keeps
multiple copies of each element. Alternatively, we can define it as:

\begin{align*}
  &U \equiv \{ (v, i)~\vert~v \in H_i \} \\
  &|U| = \sum_i |H_i| \geq |H| \\
\end{align*}

We also define for every $v \in V$, the coerage set of $v$ as $cov(v, U) \equiv \{ (v, i)~\vert~(v, i) in U$.
The size of $cov(v)$ is the number of $H_i$s that contain $v_i$.

\subsubsection{Properties of $cov$}
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of coverage sets is exactly $|H|$
\item The coverage sets partition $U$, ie, $U = \bigcup_{v \in H} cov(v)$
\item $|U| = \sum_{v \in H} |cov(v)|$
\item for all $v \in H$, $|cov(v) \leq m$ 
\end{itemize}


Deifne a function $f: U \mapsto \{0, 1\}$ as $f((v, i)) = 1~\text{if}~i = \min \{j~|~ v \in H_j \}$,
and $0$ otherwise.

Define $G \equiv \{ (v, j) \in U~\vert~f((v, j)) = 1 \}$. Notice that
$|G| = |H|$.
