\chapter{Introductory class}

The difference between mathematical truths and factual truths.

\section{The problem of psychologism}

Even though mathematics seems objective, we still filter
mathematics through our psychology, so it might not be
as objective as we want it to be.

\chapter{Descartes: Meditations, Doubt and Belief}

He begins with \textit{methodic doubt}, where we do not question each and
every particular belief. Rather, we question the source of knowledge of our
beliefs. If this source of knowledge is open to even the least doubt, then 
we reject all beliefs which arise from this knowledge.

We start with perception, the most obvious source of knowledge. We know that
our perception can easily deceive us --- for example, madmen are clearly
deceived by their perceptions. We do not need to presuppose such an
extreme position, however. Dreams are another example where our perceptions
deceive us. Yet another example is that of temperature: We can
change our perception of hot or cold, by dipping our hands into a
jug of hot or cold water.

As an aside, ``neurotics'' have some connection with reality, ``psychotics''
have a clean break with reality. So ``madmen'' can be subdivided into
these two classes, by Freud's classification. Freud says that normal
dreams as wish fulfilment. That is, you are able to fulfil your wishes
that have been repressed. Also, nightmares are your subconcious
trying to work through some form of trauma. It is the subconcious
trying to take trauma and rework it into a managable form. They
had a patient who had a recurrent nightmare of being shot
in the head. Clearly, this is not ``wish fulfilment''.
He creates the explanation that we constantly relive a bad
experience to learn how to manage it.

Now, Descartes makes a decisive move --- Even if we are dreaming,
the \textit{content} of our dreams as mental images are
\textit{embedded in reality}.
For example, think of an imaginary/ficticious object, such
as a unicorn or a fantastic alien, or an orientable mobius strip.
Even so, there would be elements which are recognizable.

At the level of mental images, the images cannot be doubted, though
what they are images \textit{of} may not exist. The content
of the images in terms of shape, figure, and color must exist in our head,
for them to \textit{be images}. Hence, we cannot reject the existence
of figure and color.

We are also unable to reject time. Dreams can \textit{distort} time, but
we can still feel the passage of time in a dream. We are trying to move
from something that is mental, to something that is more than our thought
process.

\textbf{Subjective idealism} says that it is just my flow of conciousness,
and everything is confined to \textit{my} conciousness.

\textbf{Objective idealism} says that to even posess conciousness, we need
abstract entities that transcend just our consciousness --- for example,
time.

Since time is required to be able to dream, time cannot be reduced
to dreaming. This is called as \textbf{Transcendental philosophy}.
``Transcendental'' since we find that at the very moment we
turn inwards, a different reality. We find a transcendence in
imminence (imminence = the inner). That is, me observing
myself internally causes me to come across certain structures that
I cannot reduce to myself. For example, that of temporality.

Hence, he believes that mathematics contains some measure of
certainty. The natural sciences have an element of empericism
mixed into them. They presuppose things existing in the external
world. This presupposition is open to doubt. On the other hand,
arithmetic does not need to hypothesize the existence of
physical numbers. The ideal entity of numbers (in the sense of Plato's forms)
is something which is independent of our subjective experience.

TODO: I left this class to go back home. finish this

\chapter{Lecture 4}
Descartes is not happy with saying that this is how we are physically
constituted. So he's looking for this absolute, induibitable ground. Therefore,
he has to actually prove that there is some transcendent source which
guarantees your perception. "clear and distinct perception" is what we require,
but this is hard to get to.

"Doubt has taken the ground beneath my feet" --- At the same time, I can no
longer remain on the surface. So far, I had been on the surface and it was not
a problem for me since I had never doubted. Once I began this quest, I do not
find any absolutely certain ground. I cannot forgot about this shaky ground
and continue to live there.

He asks what he can be certain of, given hyperbolic doubt --- perception,
memory, body, figure, extension and movement are all fiction. He asks whether
his \textit{very existence}, his notion of I is in itself something real. The
act of thinking is the conformation of my existence as a thinking being. As long
as I am doubting, I exist as a doubting being. As long as I am being decieved,
I exist as a being who is decieved, and so on.

I think \textit{therefore} I am --- the \textit{therefore} is one of assinging
thinking and being equal / identity. It is \textbf{not} inference.

\subsection{The problem of personal identity}
Descartes walks into a bar. The bartender asks, "what will it be?" Descartes
responds, "I think not", and he promptly disappears.

Memory constitutes a large fragment of our personal identity. On Descartes'
theory, there is no reference to the past. We can only affirm out existence
in the now.

\subsection{Solipsilm: The sole I}

How does one get out of ones mind, to access the rest of the physical realm?
Currently, I only know my own mental appearances. Everything else is an
illusion.

Descartes wishes to reject this branch of thought. For example, he questions
whether he stops existing when we sleep. He wishes to come up with an 
explanation for our sense of continuity.


After introducting "I think therefore I am", he continues saying "I do not know
very clearly what I am, except for the fact that I am".

Imagination is imagistic, and images have already been rejected, insofar
as they refer to the external world. However, imagination which refers to the
internal world is indubitable.

The only proof certificate of existence we have found so far is
that of thinking.h

At some point, Descartes' defines the body as that which cannot be self-moved.
This is different from Aristotelian physics, where everything is self-moved
according to its telos. Descartes has broken tradition from the Aristotelian
model, to somewhat arrive at the notion of inertia. (Netwon, a century later
formalizes this).

Descartes rejects the reality of his perception, but marvels at the richness of
his perception. A mirage does not truly exist, but it exists \textit{for me}.
This brings out a gap between the external world and the internal world.
Yet, we believe that we know the external world better than the internal world.

\subsubsection{The wax example}
Descartes takes something we are absolutely sure of: For example, a piece of
wax.  He waxes poetic about this piece of wax, its physical characteristics
(sound, color, smell). When we begin to melt the wax, it heats up, loses color
and smell, becomes liquid. He then asks: "does the same wax remain after this
change?" We must confess that it does remain, no one would say otherwise.
However, by what criterion are we judging that it is the same? All of its
pyhysical characteristics have been altered!

He wishes to retain physical objects. But by his standards for indubitable
knowledge, he is forced to recourse to God. 

\subsection{Why does modern science reject teleology?}
Teleology presupposes what is to be explained. If we say that something moves
because it is supposed to move, this is not an explanation.

\section{Lecture 5}
Empericism is not the annhilation of reason. Rather, it is a viewpoint on where
reason lies: Does it lie in the mind, or does it lie within nature? That is,
are all our ideas and connections between ideas are "out there", and we are
passively listening to these. We are discovering the laws of nature, not
inventing them.

Descartes with "cogito ergo sum" is closing the gap between subject and object.
He is saying: "only that really exists for sure, which I can subjectively
grasp". The usual way of looking at things would be to say that a table exists,
and I am \textit{able to} perceive it. Descartes' view of this is that I can be
aware of the existence of the table \textit{since} I am perceiving it.

Principle of coherence: My beliefs are true if all my beliefs are coherent.

He decides to abstract from everything that is unnecessary from the piece of
wax to define the piece of wax. It's not the form, since the form changes. The
extension changes.


So, we need the notion of a god to protect us from a demon who might hinder our
clear and distinct perception. There is a circularity in his logic, where he
starts out by assuming that we need a clear and distinct perception, and
therefore we need a God. He then continues to use God to make whatever we see
through clear and distinct perception to be true.

\section{Lecture 6}

The intuition that descartes has is referred to as "clear and distinct perception",
"natural light of reason" --- This is used to describe "self-evident" objects
for Descartes. For Descartes, rationality is equivalent to self-evidence.
However, he still believes that is possible to be decieved by clear
and distinct perception due to his standards of truth.

\subsection{The circularity of the argument}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive is true.
    \item I clearly and distinctly percieve that god is not a deciever.
    \item Therefore, god has created me in such a way that everything I clearly and distinctly see is true
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item I can be certain that whatever I can see clearly and distinctly is if
        God exists
    \item I can know and be certain that God exists and is not a deceiver only
        if I know thatever I see clearly and distinctly is true
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas involved in the arguments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Formal reality}: Any idea as a mental object has formal reality. Even
        if we are hallucinating, the hallucination has a formal reality, as per
        the experience of the observer.
    \item \emph{Objective reality}: Idea insofar as it represents something outside
        itself. That is, the thought represents an object.
\end{itemize}

Formal reality cannot be false, due to "cogito ergo sum". There are all true as
figments of imagination, and therefore posess formal reality.

\subsection{Tangent}
Words like "this", "that", "now" and so on in modern philosophy are called
"indexicles". These words are somewhat special in language, since their meaning
is tied to the context of their utterance. When we say "this", we are stepping
out of language, into reality. Philosophers have argued that even "this" is a
concept which has a kind of universality to it. We can understand the word
"this" even if we do not know what specific "this" it refers to. Descartes was
the first to elucidate this with the wax example.

Wittgenstein argues against ostensive definitions (definitions which involve
pointing) --- ostensive definitions imply that meaning can be found in the
thing we are pointing to.  Alternatively, ostensive definitions imply that
language gets it meaning from reality. 

Let us say we say the sentence "this is a table", by pointing at a table.
However, the child who we are teaching about "table" needs to realise that
"table" does not refer to, say, the wood, or the color of the table.  

Wittgenstein calls this as "playing the language game".

\subsection{Formal versus Objective reality}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is as much reality in the effect as there is in the cause.
    \item something cannot arise from nothing.
    \item something more perfect cannot arise from nothing.
    \item all ideas have formal reality.
    \item objective mode of being belongs to ideas, formal modes of being
          is available to all causes of ideas.
    \item god is infinite.
    \item Therefore I could not have generated the idea.
    \item hence god must exist to affirm god.
    \item now, god has a formal reality. However, we still need to be able to
          pull god out into an objective reality.
\end{itemize}

The cause must have as much reality as its effect. From this it follows,

\begin{itemize}
    \item something cannot proceed from nothing
    \item what has more reality within itself cannot proceed from something
        with less reality. If not, this too opens up a gap of reality
\end{itemize}

There is a formal reality to all ideas, but some have greater objective reality.

I have many ideas in my head, all of which have formal reality. We wish to
judge its objective reality. For example, let us pick the idea of "substance".
The "substance" is a formal reality which has an "effect". For many of these
ideas like "motion", since I can think that I am moving, I can get the idea of
of "motion" myself, from the fact that I think I can move myself. So these
ideas of the physical world, I can access insofar as I can experience them.

However, there is only one idea that is so perfect, that I cannot derive from
myself since I am an imperfect being. Being finite, I cannot derive the idea of
the infinite. Being an imperfect being, I cannot derive the idea of the perfect
God.

The idea of God, insofar as it is a formal reality in my head, carries all of
these attributes. 

Now, every idea as an effect requires a cause, since nothing can come from
nothing. The only idea I can clearly and distinctly see, but cannot produce is
that of God. This depends on the principle that the cause (the ideas that lead
to the new idea) has to have at least as much reality as the effect (the new
idea that is generated). If this were not the case, then this too opens up a
gap, where the there is gap of reality between the cause and the effect.

Unfortunately for us, he does not believe that mathematics is perfect since he
believes in psychologism. 

However, the question is now whether God can also be attributed to
psychologism.  He believes that God is infinite, and therefore he cannot access
God. He also believes that he cannot get to the infinite by negating the
finite. In some sense, he's a intuioninst, in the mathematical sense of the
word.  Therefore, he claims that we need the capacity to negate a fact to be
able to negate it.

\section{Leture 7}

The correspondence theory of truth --- my ideas have to correspond to the
world outside.

If we have a physical object that we are viewing, then let us assume that
the object we are viewing has formal reality. Our thoghts naturally have
a formal reality (by definition). We now need to link the objective reality
of the object to the formal reality of the object.

In modern science, we do not have correspondence --- we do not need to see
atoms in order to posit atoms. What we see is indeed not what we get. The
modern scientific epistomology has broken with the idea that our ideas need to
correspond with reality in an immediate way.

The idea that what we see has to directly correspond with what we see is known
as naive realism --- naive as opposed to scientific realism, which explains what
we see in terms of complex structures.

There is another problem that occurs at the mathematical level. The correspondence
does not imply existence. For example, there is  mathematical correspondence
between reality and our mathematical ideas, but they (need not) correlate to
reality.

An example from aristotelian logic would be to say "all men are mortal" --- what
we are saying is that if there was such a thing as a man, then they would be mortal.
({\texttt{forall m in men, mortal(m)}}). Hence, there is a gap between truth
and validity.

An objection to descartes is that the ideas we have are in contradiction to the
\textit{formal} idea of God. Hence, we need some way to transport a formal god
into an objective god.

Now, he needs an argument called as the "ontological argument" which argues
that perfection \textit{must} exist.  That is, something that is perfect must
exist. This is extremely suspect.

\begin{itemize}
    \item As formal reality, all ideas that we have in our head have the same level of existence.
          Ideas might have different contents, or objective referents.
    \item This difference in content must have been generated from somewhere. If I am
        simply hallucinating, then I should not be able to create distinctions in my head.
        There are specific differences in our ideas, which cannot simply
        be explained by formal existence. One can say that this come from
        other formal ideas. However, this would lead to some kind of infinite regress.
\end{itemize}


How are we guaranteed continuity of existence? Indeed, the great mystery of
time is that it is continuous (the existence of the passage of time or the
arrow of time).  At the same time, it is discrete,  in that it is broken up
into instants. As we speak, it becomes the past. We cannot point to the
present. If time were discrete, what connects the I across two instants?
If time were truly continuous, then it would be eternal, without change.


If we take time to be discrete, Descartes argues that at each instant of time,
we have a cause that produces the I in each moment. 

Buddhists don't believe in a soul. They believe that each preceding moment 
generates the succeeding moment out of itself. There is causality operating
at the level of our soul. The soul is nothing but causality occuring over
the string of moments. This is called the "theory of dependent origination".
A cool quote by heidigger: "In passing, time remains". Hereclitis said "you
cannot step into the same river twice".
