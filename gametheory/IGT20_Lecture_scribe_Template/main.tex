\section{Recap}
This is the a special class of environments where the Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite
theorem does not hold.  A popular example of quasi-linear games are actions.

\section{Introduction}
(We follow some of the exposition of
\href{http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/gametheory/ln/web-md6-quasilinear.pdf}{Game Theory by Y. Narahari: The quasilinear environment}).
The structure of the quasi-linear setting is as follows:

\begin{align*}
X \equiv \left\{ (k, t_1, \dots, t_n) : k \in K, t_i \in \R, \sum_i t_i \leq 0 \right\}.
\end{align*}


where $X$ is the space of alternatives, $K$ is the set of possible allocations.
$k \in K$ is the currently chosen allocation, and $t_i$ are monetary transfer receives by agent $i$.
By convention $t_i > 0$ implies that the agent \emph{receives money}, and
$t_i < 0$ implies that the agent \emph{is paid money}. We assume that our
agents have no external source of funding (the \emph{weakly budget-balanced}
condition). Hence, we stipulate that $\sum_i t_i \leq 0$.

A social choice function (henceforth abbreviated as SCF) in this setting
is of the form $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$, where we write 
$f(\theta \in \Theta) \equiv (k(\theta), t_1(\theta), t_2(\theta), \dots, t_n(\theta)) \in X$.
That is, we require that $k: \Theta \rightarrow K$, $t_i: \Theta \rightarrow \R$
such that for alll $\theta \in \Theta, \sum_i t_i(\theta) \leq 0$.

This setting is known as quasi-linear since the agent's utility function
is of the form:
\begin{align*}
	&u_i: X \times \Theta_i \rightarrow \R; 
	u_i(x, \theta_i) \equiv u_i((k, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n), \theta_i) = v_i(k, \theta_i) + t_i \\
	&v_i: K \times \Theta_i \rightarrow \R \equiv \text{(Agent $i$'s valuation)} \quad t_i \equiv \text{amount paid to agent} 
\end{align*}

Here, $v_i : \Theta \rightarrow \R$ is the agent's valuation function, and $t_i$
is the amount that is paid (or is to be paid) by the agent. This informs
our choice of sign convention for $t_i$: if the agent $i$ \emph{is paid}, then
it has earned money, $t_i$ is positive, its utility is higher. 

\begin{definition}{Allocative Efficiency(AE)}
We say that a social choice function $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$
is allocatively efficient iff for all states of private information,
the SCF causes us to choose the allocation that leads to the \emph{maximum common good}.
More formally,  for all $(\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_n) \in \Theta$, we have that:
$$k(\theta) \in \arg \max_{k \in K} \sum_{i=1}^n v_i(k, \theta_i).$$

Equivalently:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n v_i(k(\theta), \theta_i) = \arg \max_{k \in K} \sum_{i=1}^n v_i(k, \theta_i).
$$
\end{definition}


We can think about this as saying:
\begin{quote}
``Every allocation is value-maximizing allocation. Allocations are given to
those agents that covet them.''
\end{quote}

\begin{definition}{Budget Balance(BB)}
Recall that a social choice function $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$ is said to be
\emph{budget-balanced} iff the total money is conserved for all states
of private information. Formally:

$$\forall \theta \in \Theta, ~ \sum_i t_i(\theta) = 0$$
\end{definition}

We first show that the class of quasi-linear functions is non-degenerate,
in the sense that it is non-dictatorial.

\begin{lemma}
All social choice function $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$
in the quasilinear setting are non-dictatorial.
\end{lemma}
Let us assume we have a dictator who is player $d$ (for dictator).
For every $\theta \in \Theta$, we have that:

$$
u_d(f(\theta), \theta_d) \geq u_d(x, \theta_d) ~~\forall x \in X.
$$

This models a dictator since this tells us that $u_d$ gets what he wants
for all scenarios. Written differently:

$$
u_d(f(\theta), \theta_d) = \max_{x \in X} u_d(x, \theta_d)
$$

Since our environment is quasi-linear, we have that
$u_d(f(\theta), \theta_d) = v_d(k(\theta), \theta_d) + t_d(\theta)$. Hence, 
we can an alternative $f' : \Theta \rightarrow X$:

$$
f(\theta)
\begin{cases}
(k(\theta), (t_{-d}(\theta), t_d \equiv t_d(\theta)  - \sum_i t_i(\theta))) & \sum_{i=1}^n t_i(\theta) < 0
\end{cases}
$$
% & \sum_{i=1}^n t_i(\theta) = 0
% \end{cases}
% $$

For the following outcome, we have that $u_d(x, \theta) > u_d(f'(\theta), \theta_d)$
which contradicts the assumption that $d$ is a dictator.

\qed.



\begin{definition}{Ex-post efficiency}
Recall that Ex-post efficiency is when the item is always allotted to the agents
that value it the most. Formally, we state that a
social choice function $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$ is said to be \emph{Ex-post efficient} iff:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n u_i(k(\theta), \theta_i) = \arg \max_{k \in K} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i(k, \theta_i).
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
A social choice function $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$
in the quasilinear setting is Ex-post efficient (EPE)
iff it is budget-balanced.
\end{lemma}

We can either relax DSIC or relax rich preference structure. We decided
to look at quasi-linear environments where we relax preferences. A popular
example of this is auctions.

$X = \{ (k, t_1, \dots, t_n) : k \in K, t_i \in \R, \sum_i t_i \leq 0 \}$

$t_i$ is monetary transfer receives by agent $i$.

$u_i(x, \theta_i) = v_i(k, \theta_i) + t_i$. Linear in $t_i$, hence
the setting is quasi-linear. Often it is even $k_i \cdot \theta_i + t_i$ --- these
settings are known as linear settings.

\section{Examples of SCF in quasi-linear settings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Players}: Seller and two buyers
    \item \textbf{Private information}: Seller $\Theta_0 = \{ 0 \}$. Byers = $\theta_1 =\theta_2 = [0, 1]$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Allocative efficiency}
an SCF $f(\cdot)$ is allocative efficient if it maximises sum of valuations
of agents. We assume such a maxima does exist.
$k^{\star}(\theta) \in \arg \max_{k \in K} \sum_{i=1}^n v_i(k, \theta_i)$

We also want budget balance:

$\sum_{i=1}^n t_i(\theta) = 0$.

\section{Properties of SCF(Social choice function) in quasi-linear settings}

\begin{lemma}
All SCFs in quasi-linear settings are non dictatorial.
\end{lemma}

because $\sum_i t_i < 0$, we can increase payment for the dictator by using
$t_i + \frac{e}{n - 1}$ and decrease everyone else to $t_i - \frac{e}{n-1}$.
So, there is always an outcome that is better for a dictator. Hence,
the best outcome cannot have a dictator.

\section{Ex-post efficiency}
in quasi linear, scf is exp-post efficient iff if is allocatively efficient
and strictly budget balanced. We have to prove that $EPE \implies AE + SBB$,
and also $AE + SBB \implies EPE$.

Suppose $f = (k, t)$ is EPE but not SBB. So there exists a $\theta$ such that 
$\sum_i t_i(\theta) < 0$. Hence, there exists at least
one agent $j$ such that $t_j < 0$. (If everyone is positive, sum cannot be less than 0).

Now consider a new allocation $X' = (k, t')$ where 

$t'_j(\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
    t_j(\theta) -  \sum_i t_i(\theta)/n & \text{if $t_j(\theta) < 0$} \\
    t_j(\theta) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$ 

Hence, $u'_j(k, t') > u_j(k, t)$ for such $j$ where $t_j(\theta) < 0$.
For other agents, $u'_j(k, t') = u'_j(k, t)$.

This means that $(k. t')$ pareto dominates $(k. t)$. This is a contradiction
to the assumption that $f$ was EPE, since we constructed an outcome where
one agent does better, and others don't do worse.

We now argue that f must be allocatively efficient, if  f is EPE. For contradiction,
let us assume that $f$ is not AE.
That means that there is a $k^\star$ such that
$\sum_i v_i(k^\star, \theta) > v_i (k, \theta)$.

Define $t_i'(\theta)  = v_i(k, \theta) - t_i (\theta) - \sum_j \theta_j(k^\star, \theta) + \epsilon$
where $\epsilon < \sum_j v_j(k^star, \theta) - theta_j (k, \theta)$.

Note that $v_i(k, \theta) - t_i (\theta)  = u_i(k, t)$. 
Now note that
$u_i(k^\star, t') = u_i(k, t) + \epsilon/n$, where $\epsilon$ is positive.
Hence, $u_i(k^\star, t') > u_i(k, t)$. 

We need to check that $t'$ is feasible: ie, $\sum_i t_i' < 0$.

$$
\sum_i t_i' = \sum_i v_i(k, theta) - \sum v_j(k^\star, \theta) + \sum_i t_i(\theta) \leq 0??
$$

Also note that for all $i$, $u_i(k^\star, t') > u_i(k, t)$. This is contradiction
to the fact that $f$ is APE. Hence, $f$ must be AE.

\section{Other way round: if $f$ is AE + SBB, then it is EPE}

For this, we will need to prove a lemma:

\begin{lemma}
If $f: \Theta \rightarrow X$ st $\forall \theta \in \Theta$,
$$
\sum_i u_i(f(\theta), \theta_i) \geq \sum_i u_i(x, \theta_i) \forall x \in X
$$
then $f$ is EPE.

The key idea is to write $u_i = v_i + t_i$, an we can get rid of $t_i$ since
$f$ is SBB.
\end{lemma}

\section{First price versus second price auction}
First price: reporting valuation truthfully is not an equilibrium. Second
price: truthful reporting is equilibrium.

How do we generalize this to more situations? The key idea is that in a second
price auction, our payment is independent of what we report. The allocation
might depend on our payment, but payment does not. How can we have more
DSIC mechanisms?

\section{Groves theorem}
TODO: fill up groves theorem



Three families A B C, can go to Munnar or Simla. 


\begin{tabular}{l r r l}
  &  Manali &  Shimoga & \\
Alice & -1 &  10 & \\
Bob & 5  & -2  & \\
Claire & 5  & 4  & (Claire is a kid, loves vacations) \\
\end{tabular}

We want to get this information truthfully, by using VCG/Groves mechanism.

there are two outcoomes, M or S . If we go to M, the tuility is 5+5-1=9. If
we choose S, it is 10-2+4=12. so S is allocatively efficient.



\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r r r}
    & $\{ A \}$  & $\{ B \}$   & $\{ C \}$  &  $\{ A, B \}$ & $\{ A, C \}$ & $\{ B, C  \}$ & $\{  A, B, C \}$ \\
$P_1$  & 10 & 0   & 5  &  10  &  20 &   5  &  20 \\
$P_2$  & 0  & 9   & 15  &  9  &  15 &  20  &  20 \\
$P_3$  & 10 &  2   & 2  &  10  &  12 &  2  &   28 \\
$P_4$  & 8  &  3   & 3  &  8  &   8 &   3  &    8
\end{tabular}


Giving $A$ to $P_1$ and $BC$ to $P_2$ gives $10 + 20 = 30$.


A direct revelation mechanism in which $f$ satisfies allocative efficiency
and the groves payment scheme is knows as the groves mechanism.

before this, there is another mechanism called as Clarke's mechanism

\section{Clarke's mechanism}

$h_i(\theta_i) = \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(k_{-i}^\star(\theta_{-i}, \theta_j)) \forall \theta_{-i} \in \Theta_{-i}$

That is, each agent $i$ receives
$$
t_i(\theta) = \sum_{j \neq i}(v_j(k^\star(\theta), \theta_j)) - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(k^\star_{-i}(\theta_{-i}), \theta_j))
$$

This works for combinatorial auctions as well. It's a generalization
of second-price auction.

\begin{tabular}{l r r l}
  & M & S & \\
A &-1  &10 &  \\
B & 5  &-2 & \\
C & 5 & 4 &  (C is a kid, loves vacations) \\
\end{tabular}

For player A, first consider:

\begin{tabular}{l r r l}
   & M  & S & \\
A  & -  & -  & \\
B  & 5  & -2 & \\
C  & 5  & 4  & (C is a kid, loves vacations) \\
\end{tabular}

AE is M. 

Following Clarke Mechanism:
\begin{align*}
t_A = &[\text{valuation of remaining agents at allocatively efficient outcome without A}](-2+4)  \\
     & - [\text{valuation of remaining agents at allocatively efficient outcome with A}][5+5] \\
     = 8
\end{align*}


for player B, first consider:

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
    A    & -1 &  10 & \\
B    &  - & -1 &  -   \\
C    &  5 & -1 &  4  \\
     &  M & -1 &  S 
\end{tabular}

AE is S.  So, $t_B = 0$. Similarly, $t_C = 0$.
