\section{Hierarchy theorems}
$\exists L$, such that $\forall f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, where $f$ is
space/time constructible,
\begin{align*}
    Space(f) &\supsetneq Space(o(f)) \\
    Time(f) &\supsetneq Time \bigg (\frac{o(f)}{log f} \bigg )
\end{align*}

So, there is a Hierarchy of complexity classes in time and space.

\subsection{Proof sketch}
We exhibit a languag $A$, such that $A \in Space(f(n))$, and $A \notin Space(o(f(n))$.

Let $D$ decide $A$. D's definition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item compute $f(n)$ and mark the end of $f(n)$ cells. If the read-write head
        ever crosses it, \texttt{REJECT}, \texttt{HALT}. We first need
        $f(n)$ to use $f(n)$ cells or less to compute. This is called as 
        \textbf{space-constructribility}. ($f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is
        space-constructible iff given $n$, $\exists$ TM which computes $f(n)$ 
        using at most $f(n)$ cells). Also, we want $f(n)$ to be at least
        $log(n)$. Clearly, this process is in space $f(n)$.

    \item We now need to "seaparate" A from the smaller classes. If A can be
        solved in a smaller space (ie, we cannot separate $A$), then
        there must be a TM (say, $D'$) which decides A in space less than $f(n)$.
        So now, we need to choose some input such that $D'$ is different from $D$.
        We can use diagonalization to construct such a function.

    \item let the input be $x$. Let $x = M10*$ for some TM $M$. if not,
        \texttt{REJECT}, \texttt{HALT}.

    \item Let $D$ simulate $M$ on input $M$. If $M$ takes less that $f(n)$
        time to run on $M$, then $M$ can decide A in time less than $f(n)$.
        So now, $D$ knows how much space $M(M)$ requires. if $M(M)$
        accepts, we reject.  If $M(M)$ rejects, we accept (diagonalization).

    \item To find out whether $M(M)$ rejects, note that it is space-bounded, so
        we can just check how many states of the configuration space it visits.
        If it has not halted after visiting all states in the configuration
        space, we can conclude that $M(M)$ does not halt. The configuration space
        is $O(2^{f(n)})$. So we need to run $D$ for time $O(2^f(n))$, and then
        \texttt{REJECT} if it continues running.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Arjun Q:} Are there examples of non-space constructible functions, which are non-trivial?
Other than ones that are too-small?
