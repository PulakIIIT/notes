\section{Hierarchy theorems}
$\exists L$, such that $\forall f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, where $f$ is
space/time constructible,
\begin{align*}
    Space(f) &\supsetneq Space(o(f)) \\
    Time(f) &\supsetneq Time \bigg (\frac{o(f)}{log f} \bigg )
\end{align*}

So, there is a Hierarchy of complexity classes in time and space.

\subsection{Proof sketch}
We exhibit a languag $A$, such that $A \in Space(f(n))$, and $A \notin Space(o(f(n))$.

Let $D$ decide $A$. D's definition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item compute $f(n)$ and mark the end of $f(n)$ cells. If the read-write head
        ever crosses it, \texttt{REJECT}, \texttt{HALT}. We first need
        $f(n)$ to use $f(n)$ cells or less to compute. This is called as 
        \textbf{space-constructribility}. ($f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is
        space-constructible iff given $n$, $\exists$ TM which computes $f(n)$ 
        using at most $f(n)$ cells). Also, we want $f(n)$ to be at least
        $log(n)$. Clearly, this process is in space $f(n)$.

    \item We now need to "seaparate" A from the smaller classes. If A can be
        solved in a smaller space (ie, we cannot separate $A$), then
        there must be a TM (say, $D'$) which decides A in space less than $f(n)$.
        So now, we need to choose some input such that $D'$ is different from $D$.
        We can use diagonalization to construct such a function.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Arjun Q:} Are there examples of non-space constructible functions, which are non-trivial?
Other than ones that are too-small?
