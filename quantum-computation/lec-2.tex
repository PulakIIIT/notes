\subsection{Projectors --- $P$}

Suppose $W$ is a $k$-dimensional vector subspace of the $d$-dimensional 
vector space $V$. 

Using Gram-Schmidt, it is possible to construct an orthonormal basis
$\ket{1}, \ket{2}, \dots \ket{d}$ for $V$ such that $\ket{1} \dots \ket{k}$
is an orthonormal basis for $W$. Then the projector $P$ is defined as:
\begin{align*}
    P_W \equiv \sum_{i=1}^k \ketbra{i}
\end{align*}
